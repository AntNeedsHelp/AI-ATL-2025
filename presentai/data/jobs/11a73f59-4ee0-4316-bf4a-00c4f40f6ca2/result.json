  "transcript": "People often ask me for tips on how they can become better public speakers. Many are actually quite surprised by my answers, because I tell them to do things that are the complete opposite to what most traditional speaking uh coaches advise. I don't tell people to start with something about themselves, for example. I tell people never to use big words. They make you sound arrogant and it makes it harder to connect with people. And one of the things that really annoys traditional speaking coaches is I tell people that it's totally fine to say um or ah. I say um all the time. Go watch any of the talks I've ever given, I say um constantly. But it makes me sound more human. Great presenters aren't the ones with the most energy. They're the ones that know how to connect to people in front of them.",
